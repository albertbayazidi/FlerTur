# TASKS
- Add data collection function that reads a page after the full list has been retrieved
    - Store the URL
    - Store the price
    - Store the date
    - Store the time of retrieval
- Add saving function (JSON or binary, something easy to save and retrieve)
- Add cron job
    - Could be nice to have cronjob changes automatily retrived from repo.
- Add frontend interaction with a table of prices and dates, (could be sent to the user with the page)
- Add concurrency  
    - Try adding concurrency in the form of having two threads, each with 7 tabs and one browser
    - Try converting each function call to collect data into a separate process so each can be handled concurrently
